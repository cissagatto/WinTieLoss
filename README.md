# Win-Tie-Loss Tool

Welcome to the **Win-Tie-Loss Tool**, an easy-to-use R package for comparing multiple methods across different datasets. This tool allows you to calculate and visualize the win-tie-loss outcomes between methods using a single command. Whether you're working on machine learning, bioinformatics, or any other domain where method comparison is crucial, this tool has you covered.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Win-Tie-Loss Calculation**: Quickly compute win-tie-loss comparisons across multiple methods.
- **Flexible Measure Types**: Supports both maximization (e.g., precision) and minimization (e.g., hamming loss) objectives.
- **Customizable Visualizations**: Generate professional bar plots to visualize your results with full control over layout and design.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Simply provide your data in CSV format, call the functions, and get your results.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Prepare your dataset in a CSV format. The CSV should have the following structure:

| datasets  | method 1 | method 2 | method ... | method M |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| dataset 1 |   0.85   |   0.80   |    ...     |   0.90   |
| dataset 2 |   0.88   |   0.82   |    ...     |   0.89   |
| ...       |   ...    |   ...    |    ...     |   ...    |
| dataset D |   0.90   |   0.85   |    ...     |   0.92   |

Save your CSV file in the `CSVs` folder or specify a custom path when calling the functions.

### Step 2: Calculate Win-Tie-Loss

To compute the win-tie-loss metrics, load your data and call the function:

```r
result <- compute.win.tie.loss(data, measure.type)
```

- **`data`**: Your dataset in CSV format, read into a DataFrame.
- **`measure.type`**: 
  - `1` if a higher value indicates better performance (e.g., precision).
  - `0` if a lower value indicates better performance (e.g., hamming loss).

### Step 3: Visualize Your Results

Generate a bar plot to visualize your win-tie-loss comparison:

```r
plot.win.tie.loss(data = result, 
                  names.methods = c("method1", "method2", "method3"),
                  name.file = "~/Plots/measure1.pdf",
                  width = 10, height = 7,
                  bottom = 5, left = 4, top = 2, right = 2,
                  size.font = 1, 
                  wtl = c("Win", "Tie", "Loss"))
```

- **`data`**: The result from `compute.win.tie.loss`.
- **`names.methods`**: A vector of method names to label your plot.
- **`name.file`**: The path to save the plot as a PDF.
- **`width`, `height`**: Dimensions of the PDF.
- **`bottom`, `left`, `top`, `right`**: Margins for the plot.
- **`size.font`**: Font size for the plot labels.
- **`wtl`**: A vector with labels for "Win", "Tie", and "Loss" (can be localized).

## Example Use Case

Imagine you're comparing the performance of several machine learning models on different datasets. After computing the results using `compute.win.tie.loss`, you can easily generate a visual comparison highlighting which methods perform best overall.
