\title{Create a List of Evaluation Metrics}
\usage{
wtl.measures()
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{names}: A character vector of metric names.
\item \code{type}: An integer vector representing the evaluation type of each metric.
}
The total number of metrics equals the length of the \code{names} vector.
}
\description{
This function creates a data frame containing the names of evaluation metrics,
their corresponding types, and the total count of metrics.
Each metric is categorized by its type, which indicates whether a higher
or lower value represents better performance.
}
\details{
The \code{type} vector categorizes metrics as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{1}: Metrics where a higher value indicates better performance.
\item \code{0}: Metrics where a lower value indicates better performance.
}

Below is a summary of the metrics and their evaluation types:
