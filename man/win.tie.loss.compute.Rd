\title{Compute Win–Tie–Loss Summary for Methods}
\usage{
win.tie.loss.compute(data, measure.type)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} containing the scores of different methods.
\itemize{
\item Columns represent methods.
\item Rows represent datasets or experimental runs.
\item NA values are replaced by 0.
}}

\item{measure.type}{An integer (0 or 1) indicating the direction of optimization:
\itemize{
\item \code{1} – higher scores are better (wins if method1 > method2)
\item \code{0} – lower scores are better (wins if method1 < method2)
}}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} summarizing the number of wins, ties, and losses per method.
It has the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{method} – the method name.
\item \code{win} – total number of pairwise wins.
\item \code{tie} – total number of pairwise ties.
\item \code{loss} – total number of pairwise losses.
}
}
\description{
This function compares the performance of multiple methods across datasets by
calculating the \strong{Win–Tie–Loss (WTL)} summary.
It performs all pairwise comparisons between methods based on their scores,
counting how many times each method wins, ties, or loses relative to the others.

The function is useful in benchmarking and performance evaluation studies,
where you want to summarize how often each method performs better or worse
than the others according to a given metric (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, F1-score).
}
\details{
The function expects a data frame where:
\itemize{
\item Each \strong{column} corresponds to a method.
\item Each \strong{row} corresponds to a dataset, experiment, or observation.
}

Pairwise comparisons are performed for every combination of methods.
NA values are replaced with 0 before computation.

If \code{measure.type = 1}, \strong{higher values are better} (e.g., accuracy).
If \code{measure.type = 0}, \strong{lower values are better} (e.g., RMSE, error rate).

#--------------------------------------------------------------
# Example: Compute Win–Tie–Loss from random data
#--------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Load example dataset
data_path <- "~/WinTieLoss/Data/random-data.csv"
data <- data.frame(read.csv(data_path))
data <- data[, -1]  # Remove first column (dataset names)

# 2. Define measure type
# Suppose lower is better (e.g., clp)
measure.type <- 0

# 3. Compute Win–Tie–Loss summary
results <- win.tie.loss.compute(data = data, measure.type = measure.type)

# 4. Sort by method
methods.names <- colnames(data)
results$method <- factor(results$method, levels = methods.names)
results <- results[order(results$method), ]

# 5. Print results
print(results)

# 6. Save to CSV
output_path <- "~/WinTieLoss/Results/wtl-summary.csv"
write.csv(results, output_path, row.names = FALSE)
}
