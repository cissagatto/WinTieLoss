\title{Compare Results Between Two Methods}
\usage{
compare.results(method1, method2, names, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{method1}{A data frame containing performance metrics for the first method. 
Must include columns for wins, ties, and losses.}

\item{method2}{A data frame containing performance metrics for the second method.
Must include columns for wins, ties, and losses.}

\item{names}{A character vector of length 2, providing the names of the two methods
being compared.}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of comparison. 
Acceptable values are "wins", "ties", or "losses".}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\item{Method}{The names of the two methods being compared.}
\item{Total}{The total count of wins, ties, or losses for each method, depending on the comparison type.}
\item{Best}{A character string indicating which method performed better. 
            Values can be "Yes", "No", or "Tie".}
}
\description{
This function compares the results of two methods based on their performance metrics,
such as wins, ties, or losses. It calculates the total for each method and determines
which method performed better.

# Example usage
method1_results <- data.frame(win = c(3, 5), tie = c(1, 0), loss = c(2, 1))

compare.results(method1 = method1_results, method2 = method2_results, 
                names = c("Method A", "Method B"), type = "wins")
