\title{Process Maximum and Minimum Metrics from a CSV File}
\usage{
process_max_min(file, measure)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A character string representing the path to the CSV file that contains
performance metrics. The file should have a column named \code{method},
along with \code{win}, \code{tie}, and \code{loss} columns.}

\item{measure}{A character string that indicates the measure associated with the
results being processed (e.g., "clp", "mlp").}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the following columns:
\item{measure}{The measure associated with the results.}
\item{Max_Min}{Categories of metrics (e.g., max_win, min_win, etc.).}
\item{Methods}{The method corresponding to the maximum or minimum value in the respective category.}
\item{Value}{The maximum or minimum value for the respective category.}
}
\description{
This function reads a CSV file containing performance metrics for various methods,
categorizes the data into different method types, and calculates the maximum and
minimum values for wins, ties, and losses for each category.
